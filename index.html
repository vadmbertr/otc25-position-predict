        <h2>Objective</h2>

        <p>
            The goal of this mini-competition is to predict the position of 5 drifters one week into the future, based on their trajectories from the past week and collocated physical fields. <br>
            The drifters will be deployed in May during the <a href="https://oceantrainingcourse2025.esa.int/" target="_blank">2025 ESA Ocean Training Course</a> .
        </p>

        <p>
            Rather than predicting the exact position of the drifters, you are asked for each drifter to estimate a search area where it is likely to be found.
        </p>

        <p>
            Several rounds of predictions will be held every week. <br>
            <b>The mini-competition is due to start at the beginning of May</b>, and the precise schedule of the rounds will be announced here at that time.
        </p>

        <p>
            The participant with the most successes across rounds and drifters will be declared the winner.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting started</h2>

        <b><i>Full demo video <a href="#">here</a>!</i></b>

        <p>
            For each round (8:00 AM CET to 6:00 PM CET):
            <ol>
                <li>Visit the <a href="https://odl.bzh/DpY-yLwF" target="_blank">Ocean Virtual Laboratory portal</a>.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Play with the displayed data and the time wheel.</li>
                    <li>Draw your search areas, each <b>smaller than 100 km<sup>2</sup></b>.</li>
                    <li>Download them as a GeoJSON file.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Submit your predictions <b>before 6:00 PM CET</b> using this <a href="./submit.html">form</a>.</li>
                <li>At the end of the round, around 6:15 PM CET, check the updated <a href="./leaderboard.html">leaderboard</a>.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Detailed rules</h2>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each participant can submit only one prediction file per round (participants can update their prediction during a round: if multiple predictions are submitted for the same round, the last attempt is used).</li>
                <li>A round starts at 8:00 AM CET and ends at 6:00 PM CET on the same day.</li>
                <li>A submission consists of a GeoJSON file containing one "feature" per drifter.</li>
                <li>Each "feature" must have a "geometry" field with a "Polygon" type.</li>
                <li>Each "feature" must have a "properties" field with a "text" property whose value is the ID of the drifter.</li>
                <li>Each "Polygon" must have an area smaller than or equal to 100 km<sup>2</sup>.</li>
                <li>The submission file must be uploaded using this <a href="./submit.html" target="_blank">form</a>.</li>
                <li>The submission file must be uploaded before the 6:00 PM deadline.</li>
                <li>A prediction is successful if the predicted area contains its drifter position.</li>
                <li>The winner is determined as follows:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Highest total number of successes across all rounds and drifters,</li>
                    <li>In case of ties: smallest sum of the successful prediction zone areas across rounds and drifters,</li>
                    <li>In case of ties: smallest sum of the distances between the successful prediction zone's barycenter and the drifter's position across rounds and drifters,</li>
                    <li>In case of ties: no coin flip, you will have the share the prize (if any).</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
